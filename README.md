The project offers a RestApi application that takes orders from an institution's
customers and products, and tracks the company's product additions and
subsequent sales to its users.
Spring Boot, Spring RestApi, Spring Security, JPA, MySql, Javax Validation and
Spring Mail Framework APIs are used in the project software. In the project, service
procurement was provided according to roles with the JWT method. In the project,
the data that is regularly consumed in case of need has been worked with cache
methods and the application cost has been brought to the most ergonomic level.
